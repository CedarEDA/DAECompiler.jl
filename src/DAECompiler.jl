    @declare_MTKConnector(mtk_component::MTK.ODESystem, ports...)

Declares a connector function that allows you to call a component defined in MTK from DAECompiler.

!!! note "for this to function ModelingToolkit must be loaded"
    DAECompiler itself only provides a stub-defination of this type.
    The full implementation is in the DAECompiler-ModelingToolkit extension module.
    Which is automatically loaded if DAECompiler and ModelingToolkit are both loaded.

It takes a component as represented by an ODESystem, and a list of "ports" which correpond to variables in the component,
as identified by their references in the component.
This returns a constructor for a struct that accepts any of the parameters the mtk_component accepted, passed by keyword argument.
The struct itself (once constructed by passing zero or more parameters) accepts in positional arguments in order correponding to each port declared earlier a variable
(or even an expression) respectively  and will impose the connection between that variable in the outer system and the variable inside the port.

See [`MTKConnector`](@ref) for more info.

Note: this (like `include` or `eval`) always runs at top-level scope, even if invoked in a function.

!!! note "There is no need to call structural_simplify on ODESystem before using in @declare_MTKConnector"
    You might think it makes sense to simplify the the subsystem before passing it to the @declare_MTKConnector.
    However, until the system is connected fully such simplification can produce problematic results,
    In particular, it may (during tearing) simplify away one of the variables that you were going to connect to a port.
    DAECompiler will perform simplifications on the whole system once it is all connected regardless, so there is no need to call `structural_simplify` earlier.
    As such we disregard any simplifications done to the model before we use it.

    MTKConnector

Abstract type for a MTK model (ODESystem) that has been rewrappen to expose as a DAECompiler functor.
It's subtypes are created using `@declare_MTKConnector(mtk_model, mtk_ports...)`
Such subtypes provides:
 - `propertynames`/`getproperties` that returns the values of the parameters,
 - a constructor that takes a set of keyword argument for overriding the values of hte parameters
 - a functor that takes DAECompiler values/expressions that are used to override the ports,
 and a [`Scope`](@ref) to use for variables and equations created with-in it. (default: no subscope)

To work at a higher level of abstraction (e.g. CedarSim `AbstractNet`s) you will likely want to add aditional functor overloads.


Generally if you have parameters you want to be user-setable you will make the MTKConnector struct a field of your DAE system.
In this case you should make sure it is concetely typed field e.g. by making it type-parametric and passing in an instance.
If on the other hand, you have no parameters, or you don't need them to be user-setable and want to hard code their value, you can instead put it in a `const` global variable
(In CedarSim it works to interpolate in an instance into the SPICE code).

Usage Example:
```
# At top-level
# consider some MTK OD system with parameter `a` and variables `x` and `y`
const foo = ODESystem(...; name=:myfoo_mtk) # Note the name we pass here has no effect but is required by ODESystem constructor
const FooConn = @declare_MTKConnector(foo, foo.x)`
const foo_conn! = FooConn(a=1.5)
#...
function (this::MyDAESystem)()
    (;outer_x,) = variables()
    foo_conn!(outer_x; dscope=Scope(Scope(), :myfoo))
    #...
end
sys = IRODESystem(Tuple{MyDAESystem})

sys.myfoo.y  # references the value `y` from within the `foo` that is within the system
```
